# App Name: MuseAI
### Streamlit Link: https://museai-music-generator.streamlit.app/
### App Description:
MuseAI is a web application, powered with GPT 3.5 Turbo model that can generate a list of songs based on the user’s preferences.Deployed in Streamlit, it has a simple yet straightforward interface that users can easily navigate.

It has three levels of prompts. The first one asks the users their current feelings. After typing in and pressing enter on the keyboard, a response would appear together with the next section. The second section will ask the user their preferred genre and language. After submitting by pressing enter, the third and last section would appear, which would ask the user the speed (tempo) of their preferred music, what they are currently doing, and how many songs they would like to generate. A “generate button list” would appear after the user filled out all the information.

MuseAI is developed by EJ Prince Sevilleno, BSCS3A for the course CCS229 (Intelligent Systems) under the guidance of Louie F. Cervantes M.Eng..
